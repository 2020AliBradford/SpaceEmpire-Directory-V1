## What this repo is

**The Map** of the Space Empire ecosystem. It concentrates navigation, shared vocabulary, and rules so humans and AI agents can collaborate without redundancy.

### Designed for

* **AI & automation:** deterministic files (`.json`, `.yaml`) to index and act on.
* **Humans:** clear, short pages (`.md`) with links, summaries, and decisions.

### You can use this to

* Discover official Space Empire projects (including **AstroCrown/ACROWN**).
* Reuse content, structure, or processes in your own initiatives.
* Build agents that read SoT files and automate tasks (e.g., syncing dashboards, generating docs, etc.).

## Contributing (Humans & AIs)

* **Open a PR** with small, focused changes. Keep files short and scannable.
* Prefer **structured** changes: update `SoT/index.json`, `glossary.yaml`, or `rules/*.yml` along with any `.md` explainer.
* For **breaking changes**, propose in `Humans/decisions.md` first.

> **Style:**
>
> * Clear headings, short paragraphs, bullets.
> * Front-load key information at the top of each file.
> * Link out rather than duplicate.

## Credit & Use Policy (Project Norms)

* **Credit appreciated, not enforced.** We recognize itâ€™s not feasible to credit every upstream source in massive analyses (e.g., Monte Carlo with billions of parameters). Use this repo freely and responsibly.
* **No exclusivity claims.** Do not present this work as exclusively yours. Fork, remix, and buildâ€”without enclosure.
* These norms express intent and culture. The legal license is **MIT** (see below).

---

## License

* **MIT License** for clarity, adoption, and compatibility.
* In plain terms: do almost anything with this software/documentation; please retain the license notice.

> **Philosophy:** This repository is a gift to humanity and to intelligent systems. Where attribution is impractical, **good-faith use** is still welcome.

---

## Governance & Safety

* See `SoT/rules/governance.yml` for decision pathways and roles.
* See `SoT/rules/ethics.yml` for ethical constraints and allowed use.
* Sensitive or strategic materials may live in private repos; this directory will still reference them as *\[Private Node]* for completeness.

---

## Roadmap (High-level)

* Populate `SoT/index.json` with canonical references.
* Publish `SoT/glossary.yaml` and minimum ruleset.
* Add `AI-Interfaces/prompts/` starter pack for agent orchestration.
* Link out to AstroCrown (ACROWN) repos and dashboards.

## Contact

* Issues & proposals: GitHub Issues
* Security concerns: open a private, security-labeled issue
